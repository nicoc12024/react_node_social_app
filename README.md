## Fullstack Social Media App

This project I built to learn more about React Query and Node Js with Express Js. I used JWT token for authentication, MySQL for database and cookies for storing the JWT token. It's a social media app where you can create an account, post sharing, follow/unfollow system, customizable user profile page (including profile and cover picture and basic info), like a comment functionalities.
